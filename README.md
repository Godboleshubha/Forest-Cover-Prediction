# Dataset
The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. Independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type.
This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.Â¶

# Insights From Exploratory Data Analysis
Data set have balanced labels, resulting in equal number of cover types. This will be an advantage when it comes to apply classification ML models because, the model will have good chance to learn patterns of all labels, eliminating the probability of underfitting.

Different wilderness areas consist of some specific trees. Interestingly, there is one fantastic tree, Cottonwood/Willow, specifically likes to grow in wilderness area 4. While cover types 1, 2, 5 and 6 can grow in any soil type, other cover types grows more with specific soil types.

Soil types are reverse-one-hot-encoded, meaning they are going to be included as numeric data in the training set and one-hot-encoded soil type columns will be excluded. With that way, there is a stronger correlation between soil type and Cover_Type. Numeric soil type column and other variables have pearson coefficients in the range of [-0.2, 0.1].

Hillshade columns are collinear within each other and Hillshade_9am has the least importance in determining Cover_Type. Thus this column will be dropped in Part 3 for better interpretability of the future model.

# Based on the comparison of models trained on the forest cover prediction dataset, we can draw several insights and conclusions:

# Model Performance:

The Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved the highest accuracy among all the models considered. Decision Tree and k-NN models achieved moderate accuracy, while the SVM model lagged slightly behind. The relative performance of models may vary depending on the specific dataset and problem at hand. Complexity and Interpretability:

Decision Tree and k-NN models tend to be simpler and more interpretable compared to ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost, which are more complex and often referred to as "black-box" models. SVM falls somewhere in between, offering good accuracy with a moderate level of interpretability.

# Scalability:

k-NN and Decision Tree models are relatively straightforward and may scale well with larger datasets. SVM and ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost can be computationally intensive and may require more resources for training and inference.

# Robustness:

Ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost are generally more robust to noise and overfitting compared to simpler models like Decision Tree and k-NN. SVM can also be robust, especially with proper tuning of hyperparameters, but may require careful preprocessing and feature scaling.

# Hyperparameter Sensitivity:

Ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost have several hyperparameters to tune, but they tend to be less sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters compared to models like SVM. SVM's performance can be highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters such as the choice of kernel, regularization parameter (C), and kernel coefficient (gamma).

# Overall Recommendation:

Based on the comparison, if we prioritize accuracy and robustness and are less concerned about interpretability, ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost are preferable. If interpretability is a significant concern or computational resources are limited, simpler models like Decision Tree or k-NN can still provide reasonable performance. The choice of model ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the problem, computational resources available, and the balance between model complexity and interpretability.
